## The challenge ⏳ ✍🏽

The challenge is to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge.

The testimonials should be responsive on any device's screen size.

**Had great fun building!** 🚀
